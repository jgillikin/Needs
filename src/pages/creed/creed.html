The Needs community is a group of friends who desire to love with actions and not just words.  We agree to feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, visit the sick and imprisoned and to care for the least among us as Jesus provides.  We agree to be prayerful as we submit needs as well as resources and to give in a manner that publicly even our left hand doesn't know what our right hand is doing.  As needs are met in small ways and large, the community agrees to give Jesus of Nazareth alone the credit.
